Questions -
  Do we need support for different sorting algorithms between projects?
  Can we assume the implementer will have access to their own databases locally? (i.e. not include that in the admin page)
  
Bradley Terry model
Elo Rating System

Merge Sort?
    Good if list is entirely unsorted
Insertion Sort?
    Performance enhancement (at least for us) - use Rob's AI to sort, then use humans to confirm
